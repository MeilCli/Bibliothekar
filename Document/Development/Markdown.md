# Markdown Writing
Markdown is used for Documentation of Bibliothekar repository.  
We need [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) because Bibliothekar is hosted by GitHub.

ref: [GitHub Flaored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

## Recommendation
We can write markdown with preview at GitHub. GitHub is convenient for writing simply changes, But not convenient for writing fuge changes.

So if you write fuge change alike multiple file changes, we recommend use VS Code.

## SetUp
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Fork this repository, and clone forked-repository
1. Open forked-repository on VS Code
1. Install VS Code extensions
   - Maybe, VS Code will recommend for you
   - Install-required: [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)

## Coding convention
- Use `-` for list
- Use `1.` for numbered-list
  - Don't increment number
